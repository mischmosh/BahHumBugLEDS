# BahHumBugLEDS
Usings neopixels strips, RaspPi B and rpi_ws281x repository to spell out show "BAH" - "HUM" - "BUG" (aka my holiday spirit) using 303 leds (10meters of strips)

strips are sliced and soldered into composit letters in my front three windows, strips shine through velum as a light defuser.
